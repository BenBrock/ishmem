ishmem4py Bindings
--------------------

``ishmem4py`` is the in-tree Python interface for Intel(R) SHMEM.
It targets the same host-side workflow that the C and C++ Intel SHMEM APIs already support,
while adopting a small, Python-oriented surface inspired by ``nvshmem4py`` where the models
overlap.

The current binding is intentionally host-driven.
It now exposes queue-based host ``put`` and ``get`` operations for XPU workflows, but it does
not yet expose device-initiated Python APIs.

Memory Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ishmem4py`` keeps symmetric allocations as explicit Python objects instead of exposing the
symmetric heap as a general Python buffer.
That is deliberate:

- Intel SHMEM symmetric memory may not be directly host-accessible in every runtime mode.
- Explicit ``put`` and ``get`` calls are the portable host-side mechanism.
- Python can still use ordinary local buffers such as ``bytes``, ``bytearray``, and
  ``memoryview`` as the source or destination for host-initiated RMA.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   ishmem.init()
   try:
       buf = ishmem.malloc(16)
       buf.write(b"abcd")

       host = bytearray(16)
       ishmem.get(host, buf, pe=ishmem.my_pe())
   finally:
       ishmem.free(buf)
       ishmem.finalize()

Torch/XPU interop is also available as an optional build-time feature.
Those helpers allocate symmetric memory directly as ``torch.Tensor`` objects backed by the
Intel SHMEM heap, which is useful for host-driven one-sided XPU workflows:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch
   import ishmem4py as ishmem

   ishmem.init()
   try:
       src = ishmem.tensor((4,), dtype=torch.float32, device="xpu")
       dst = ishmem.tensor((4,), dtype=torch.float32, device="xpu")

       src.fill_(7.0)
       stream = torch.xpu.Stream()
       ishmem.put(dst, src, pe=ishmem.my_pe(), queue=stream)
       ishmem.quiet(queue=stream)
   finally:
       ishmem.free_tensor(dst)
       ishmem.free_tensor(src)
       ishmem.finalize()

When torch interop is built, the top-level module exposes ``tensor``, ``free_tensor``,
``tensor_base``, and ``is_symmetric_tensor`` lazily so that plain ``import ishmem4py`` does
not require importing PyTorch up front.

Queue-Based RMA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ishmem4py.put`` and ``ishmem4py.get`` accept an optional ``queue=...`` argument for
host-initiated queue-based Intel SHMEM operations.
This is intended for XPU workflows that pass a ``torch.xpu.Stream`` or a raw SYCL queue handle.

Completion remains host-driven: after issuing queue-based RMA, wait for the queue and then call
``ishmem.quiet(queue=stream)``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   stream = torch.xpu.Stream()
   ishmem.get(dst, src, pe=peer, queue=stream)
   ishmem.quiet(queue=stream)

Collectives and Teams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

World-team collectives are available directly from Python:

.. code-block:: python

   reduce_src = ishmem.malloc(4)
   reduce_dst = ishmem.calloc(1, 4)

   reduce_src.write((ishmem.my_pe() + 1).to_bytes(4, "little", signed=True))
   ishmem.reduce("sum", reduce_dst, reduce_src, dtype="int32")

``reducescatter`` is also available for API compatibility with ``nvshmem4py``.
Intel SHMEM does not currently expose a host-side primitive for it, so ``ishmem4py`` implements
that operation as a small software fallback on top of ``reduce``.

The binding also exposes team objects and team query or synchronization routines.
Those APIs follow Intel SHMEM handles rather than CUDA-object wrappers.

Building and Installing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build Intel SHMEM with Python bindings enabled:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S /path/to/ishmem -B /path/to/build -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ...
   cmake --build /path/to/build --target ishmem4py -j4

To include optional Torch/XPU symmetric tensor support in the package, enable the extra build:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S /path/to/ishmem -B /path/to/build \
     -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON \
     -DISHMEM4PY_BUILD_TORCH_INTEROP=ON \
     -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/python-from-torch-xpu-env \
     -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(python -c 'import torch; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)')" ...
   cmake --build /path/to/build --target ishmem4py -j4

Install from the build tree:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install /path/to/build/ishmem4py/python

For editable development, install the source tree and point it at the built runtime:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e /path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/python
   export ISHMEM4PY_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=/path/to/build/ishmem4py/python/ishmem4py/_ishmem4py_runtime.so

Testing
^^^^^^^

Typical source-tree test environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   unset ISHMEM_DIR
   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/python:/path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/test
   export ISHMEM4PY_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=/path/to/build/ishmem4py/python/ishmem4py/_ishmem4py_runtime.so
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/openshmem/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export ISHMEM_RUNTIME=OPENSHMEM

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpiexec -n 1 ishmrun python3 /path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/test/smoke_test.py
   mpiexec -n 2 ishmrun python3 /path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/test/ring_test.py
   mpiexec -n 2 ishmrun python3 /path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/test/collective_test.py
   mpiexec -n 1 ishmrun python3 /path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/test/torch_tensor_test.py
   mpiexec -n 2 ishmrun python3 /path/to/ishmem/ishmem4py/test/torch_queue_get_test.py

Use real script files for multi-PE validation rather than ``python - <<'PY'`` heredoc launches;
the latter can appear to hang under ``mpiexec`` because of stdin interaction with the process
manager.

Current Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The exported Python API is limited to functionality that has been validated in this environment.
Host atomics and dynamic team-split helpers were intentionally removed from the public bindings
after backend-level failures in the current OpenSHMEM runtime.
